British horticulturalist, Robert Fortune, upon reaching Yokohama at the end of October 1860, described the scene in terms remarkably parallel to Sadahide&amp;#39;s nearly contemporary print: &amp;quot;On our right, in the direction of Edo, we observed a cloud of boats under sail, composed chiefly of fishing boats which supply the markets of the capital and the surrounding towns with fish.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Complete Picture of the Newly Opened Port of Yokohama&lt;/i&gt; expresses in its imposing scale and meticulous detail the artist&amp;#39;s devotion to what must have been a demanding project.

One of the earliest prints ofYokohama, this view of Honch&amp;#333;-d&amp;#333;ri, the wide boulevard of the Japanese quarter, reveals no evidence of foreign settlers from the Five Nations, who in 1860 formed, in fact, only a very small community. Among the few distinctly foreign costumes are those worn by the candy vendors shown in the left foreground; their garments recall those displayed in Korean diplomatic processions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;Filling the wide street are heavily laden peddler carts pushed by laborers, and packhorses, travelers, vendors, and a few women and children. The comfortable, practical, indigo-dyed clothing of the working men parallels the description of Japanese boatsmen and dockworkers written decades later by American painter John La Farge (1835-1910) upon his arrival at Yokohama in 1886. He observed &quot;rowers standing in robes flapping about them, or tucked in above their waists. There were so many that the crowd looked blue and white - the colors of their dresses repeating the sky in prose.&quot; Dogs and even a tame boar run loose in the busy streets.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;The Japanese shops, unshuttered for the day, are full of a variety of merchandise, including the &quot;curios&quot; described in detail by Western travelers who seemed never to fail to spend some of their time shopping on Honch&amp;#333;-d&amp;#333;ri. The Japanese commercial district as depicted by Sadahide resembles the scene encountered by British horticulturalist Robert Fortune in 1869: &quot;The native town is remarkable for one fine wide street which runs down its centre. Here are exposed for sale the various productions of the country in very large quantities. Bronzes, carvings in ivory, lacquer-ware, and procelain, are all duly represented.&quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;The shop in the left foreground is marked with the distinctive trademark of Mitsui, Japan's wealthiest merchant house during the Edo period (1600-1868). Specializing in dry goods, and money lending and exchange, members of that family also served the Tokugawa shogunate as chartered merchants (&lt;i&gt;goy&amp;#333; sh&amp;#333;nin&lt;/i&gt;) who transmitted tax receipts from Osaka to Edo. Mitsui's establishment of a shop in Yokohama foreshadowed its future involvement with international trade, shipping, and finance. Having successfully adapted to rapidly changing political and economic conditions during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mitsui is now one of Japan's second-largest general trading company (&lt;i&gt;s&amp;#333;g&amp;#333; sh&amp;#333;sha&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]">

The comfortable, practical, indigo-dyed clothing of the working men parallels the description of Japanese boatsmen and dockworkers written decades later by American painter John La Farge (1835-1910) upon his arrival at Yokohama in 1886. He observed &quot;rowers standing in robes flapping about them, or tucked in above their waists. There were so many that the crowd looked blue and white - the colors of their dresses repeating the sky in prose.&quot; Dogs and even a tame boar run loose in the busy streets.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;The Japanese shops, unshuttered for the day, are full of a variety of merchandise, including the &quot;curios&quot; described in detail by Western travelers who seemed never to fail to spend some of their time shopping on Honch&amp;#333;-d&amp;#333;ri. The Japanese commercial district as depicted by Sadahide resembles the scene encountered by British horticulturalist Robert Fortune in 1869: &quot;The native town is remarkable for one fine wide street which runs down its centre. Here are exposed for sale the various productions of the country in very large quantities. Bronzes, carvings in ivory, lacquer-ware, and procelain, are all duly represented.&quot;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;The shop in the left foreground is marked with the distinctive trademark of Mitsui, Japan's wealthiest merchant house during the Edo period (1600-1868). Specializing in dry goods, and money lending and exchange, members of that family also served the Tokugawa shogunate as chartered merchants (&lt;i&gt;goy&amp;#333; sh&amp;#333;nin&lt;/i&gt;) who transmitted tax receipts from Osaka to Edo. Mitsui's establishment of a shop in Yokohama foreshadowed its future involvement with international trade, shipping, and finance. Having successfully adapted to rapidly changing political and economic conditions during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Mitsui is now one of Japan's second-largest general trading company (&lt;i&gt;s&amp;#333;g&amp;#333; sh&amp;#333;sha&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]"/>

This print, from the same series as Y0106, describes the costumes in charming detail. The necklace adorning the woman in the foreground is a Western accessory that would have seemed novel in Japan, where jewelry of that style was not worn. Her dress is probably based on the artist's study of fashion plates from European magazines of the 1820s. Knowledge of European fashions of the 1820s may have come directly through a Nagasaki print by the artist Kawahara Keiga (ca. 1787-ca. 1860). This print portrays Mevrouw Cock Blomhoff, a resident of the community of Dutch merchants who were confined to the island of Deshima before the commercial treaties of 1858 were negotiated.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;Images of foreign children are abundant in Yokohama prints despite the rarity of foreign children in Japan during the years immediately following the opening of Yokohama.

<part partId="NarraVision.Description.PartStructureId" value="The Western custom of drinking wine from stemmed glasses is often represented in Yokohama prints. This print, from the same series as Y0106, describes the costumes in charming detail. The necklace adorning the woman in the foreground is a Western accessory that would have seemed novel in Japan, where jewelry of that style was not worn. Her dress is probably based on the artist's study of fashion plates from European magazines of the 1820s. Knowledge of European fashions of the 1820s may have come directly through a Nagasaki print by the artist Kawahara Keiga (ca. 1787-ca. 1860). This print portrays Mevrouw Cock Blomhoff, a resident of the community of Dutch merchants who were confined to the island of Deshima before the commercial treaties of 1858 were negotiated.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;Images of foreign children are abundant in Yokohama prints despite the rarity of foreign children in Japan during the years immediately following the opening of Yokohama. Contrary to the series title of this print, the theme was chosen for its popular appeal rather than its authenticity as a drawing from life. &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]"/>

Sadahide seems to delight in depicting the figure of the Dutch from a dramatically close standpoint, and the man in profile. The artist employs foreshortening, a Western artistic convention of which he was especially fond, to illustrate the large dog in the background.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;The author of the inscription, Kanagaki Robun (1829-1894), was a satirical writer and journalist whose original name was Nozaki Bunz&amp;#333;. &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]"/>

The theme was introduced to Japan inthe Muromachi period (1392-1573) and adapted by Japanese printers to depict various locales including Edo.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;Yoshitora's series of eight prints represents yet another Japanese permutation of &quot;Eight Views.&quot; Eight sites around the new harbor of Yokohama are linked with the traditional subjects of the &quot;Eight Views&quot; landscapes, yet this print has none of the evocative quality found in the Chinese original. Yoshitora's series of prints departs completely from the emphasis upon landscapes traditionally seen in &quot;Eight Views&quot; pictures. Instead, an American couple dressed in striking attire stands beneath an umbrella, virtually obstructing the view of the sailboats in the distance. The foreigners of Yokohama become the dominant subject, as if the famous sites of Yokohama would be incomplete without them. The curious &quot;pineapple hat&quot; also appears in other depictions of American women (see Y0109). &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]">

<part partId="NarraVision.Description.PartStructureId" value="The title of this charming series of eight prints by Yoshitora (see also Y0120-Y0123) identifies it as one of the popular Japanese adaptations of the Chinese artistic and literary theme &quot;Eight Views of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers&quot; (&quot;&lt;i&gt;Xiao Xiang bajing&lt;/i&gt;&quot;). The theme was introduced to Japan inthe Muromachi period (1392-1573) and adapted by Japanese printers to depict various locales including Edo.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;Yoshitora's series of eight prints represents yet another Japanese permutation of &quot;Eight Views.&quot; Eight sites around the new harbor of Yokohama are linked with the traditional subjects of the &quot;Eight Views&quot; landscapes, yet this print has none of the evocative quality found in the Chinese original. Yoshitora's series of prints departs completely from the emphasis upon landscapes traditionally seen in &quot;Eight Views&quot; pictures. Instead, an American couple dressed in striking attire stands beneath an umbrella, virtually obstructing the view of the sailboats in the distance. The foreigners of Yokohama become the dominant subject, as if the famous sites of Yokohama would be incomplete without them. The curious &quot;pineapple hat&quot; also appears in other depictions of American women (see Y0109). &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]"/>

Combining elements of traditional Japanese art with an exceptionally successful reproduction of a Western artistic model, the print presents a striking if somewhat disconcerting visual effect. &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]"/>

In the center, two women assist a girl dressed in the costume of a nobleman. On stage, playing male and female roles, two young dancers strike the stylized poses of a dramatic dance. Their performance is lit by candles extended on long poles by stagehands. To the right, men provide sound effects using wooden clappers and a large drum hidden offstage. With its wealth of detail, Yoshikazu's print presents a colorful and convincing illustration of a theatrical performance in the Gankir&amp;#333;. &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]"/>

Overhead are telegraph lines, which were installed in those cities in 1869; telephones were first brought to Japan in 1877, one year after this print was published. The two-story buildings of Western merchants reflect the designs by Western architects who had first come to Japan in the 1860s; the tiled roofs, however, are Japanese in style. &lt;br&gt;Selective adoption of changing fashions alongside the persistence of tradition is apparent in the dress of the Japanese men. They wear, for the most part, Japanese garments, although their hair is cut short in the mode of the West. A Japanese man in the foreground wears Western boots and trousers, together with a Japanese robe and jacket; another, dressed in kimono, carries a Western-style umbrella. Only the peasant with a bundle tied across his shoulders retains the traditional coiffure of the Edo period, that is, the hair worn long and tied in a knot with the top of the crown shaved. The most modern style of all is demonstrated by the Japanese man who appears in the room at the lower right wearing a Western vested suit as he makes a transaction with a Western merchant. The improved design of the rickshaw can be seen in the vehicles pulled along the street, which keep pace with the horse-drawn carriage bearing a Western couple. &lt;br&gt;[Adapted from Ann Yonemura, &lt;i&gt;Yokohama: Prints from Nineteenth-Century Japan&lt;/i&gt;]">
