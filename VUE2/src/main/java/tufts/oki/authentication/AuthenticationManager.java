/**
 *  The AuthenticationManager is responsible for verifying the identity of a person or
 *  entity desiring access to OKI OSID based services.  The interface is intended to 
 *  isolate applications from the underlying details of verify a user.  Multiple
 *  authenication methods may be supported by a single interface, identified by
 *  an AuthenticationType.  In this implementation, the following types are defined:
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>AuthenticationLDAP
 *  </ul>
 *  LDAP-based authentication uses JNDI to access enterprise
 *  directory information.  Other methods, such as Kerberos are not supported at 
 *  this time.
 *  <p>
 *  The AuthenticationManager
 *  maintains a list of known authentication types, which can be accessed using
 *  getAuthenticationTypes().  This list is created and initialized here.
