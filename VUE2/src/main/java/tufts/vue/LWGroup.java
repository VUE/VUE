/**
 *
 * Manage a group of LWComponents.  A group defines it's bounds by it's members.
 * Default top-level behavour for "groups" as generally defined is that selecting
 * anything in a group with a default selection tool will actually select the group
 * itself, and allow one to reposition the group with all it's memebers at once,
 * such that all members maintain their relative position to one another.
 *
 * By default, groups in VUE have no border or fill, but these can be set
 * if desired.  Also significantly, the entire group can be dropped into
 * a scaled context (or scaled itself), and all members will still keep
 * stable positions relative to each other in the scaled context.

        // to do it right, and to make sure undo of the group creation is going to work.

        // When the new children of the group are pulled from their existing parent, we
        // want to localize the coordinates within the new group (this happens
        // automatically).  However, if the new group doesn't know it's bounds yet, we
        // can't meaninfully localize the coordinates.  So when creating groups, we use
        // setShapeFromContents to provide the initial location and size of the group
        // (as opposed to relying on generic normalization).  We can't normalize until
        // the group has at least bootstrapped to know it's initial location (the upper
        // left hand corner of the upper left most member).

        // There are also problems with adding curved links initially at group creation

        // link into a group when it is initially created.  The links will add
        // themselves as needed later via the link cleanup task.  So newly created
        // groups go through two phases: in the first phase, completed in this method,
        // there will be a group containing all non-links, fully normalized when we're
        // done.  The normalization process is different during creation in that we set
        // the location & size first (based on just the non-link content), then we
        // normalize only the added children (by calling normalize(false)) -- so their
        // locations are properly relative to the newly created group.  In the second
        // phase, all connected links to anything that was added to the group will
        // automatically run their cleanup tasks (having detected changes in the
        // endpoints), and will then be able to join an already stabilized group and
        // map-parented group, so that if it's a curved link, when localizeCoordinates
        // is called to translate it's control points into the new group coordinate
        // space, the undo manager will be able to record the old positions of those
        // control points, so they can be faithfully restored on undo.  Theoretically,
        // localizeCoordinates / setLocation on the entire link could handle this during
        // undo, tho we've had so many problems faithfully handling the redirection of
        // setLocation on links to a translate for all link sub-points (as links don't
        // have a 0,0 of their own: just sub-points recorded within their parent), that
        // ensuring we have real coordinates to restore for undo is the only safe way to
        // handle this.

        // being created, even if later it will be re-normalized by link cleanup tasks
        // adding themselves to the group.  We could be hit again someday with this
