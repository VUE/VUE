// ALTERNATIVE DESIGN: Images.getImageRef returns an ImageRef, so that multiple
// LWImage's, preview panes, etc, are all pointing to the same ImageRef.  Which means
// the cache would always contain instances of ImageRef?  Tho that conflicts with the
// idea of keeping the cache code very clean & flat: e.g., only knows about 1 key, 1
// file, and the the icon cache file generation would get handled in ImageRef.  Tho
// actually that really doesn't need to be -- Images handles fetching and caching image
// data -- if it creates icons behind the scenes, that's an impl detail.

// If we instance the ImageRef ourselves, that is more amenable to subclassing and just
// overriding the update methods we'd like -- that could be very handy.  That would work
// here and in ResourceIcon, both which always work with a single image.  But
// PreviewPane works w/multiple images, so that means it needs the callbacks, tho the
// only once it really needs are gotImage and gotImageError.

// The big advantage to having the ImageRef doing the low-level listening to the image
// loader is that it can be one place that could handle a default common form of display
// update: e.g., while image is loading, draw as a transparent box w/loading %, display
// common unavail info, etc.  It would also probably want to take a java.awt.Component
// handle for being able to issue optional repaint() calls.  It would be one standard
// place to have all the info about raw size, loading status, etc.  It could also handle
// going between a Resource (if it has one) and the image data/image icon.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Note: subclassing java.awt.Image is not actually supported; in AWT Graphics drawing:
// SurfaceManager can't get surface.  see
// http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5208043 -- basically, this is a 10+ year
// old bug that's never been fixed -- either java.awt.Image needs to be abstract or the
// impls need changing, and it looks like there's just no hope on this one at all.
// Subclassing BufferedImage MAY be possible tho...  this would lock us in 100% to never
// using ToolkitImage's, tho we can probably live with that as that impl gives us memory
// heartburn, at least on the Mac.  The bigger issue is we'd like to be able to rely on
// using createCompatibleImage for creating our BufferedImages, and not have to create
// our own delegating instances.
