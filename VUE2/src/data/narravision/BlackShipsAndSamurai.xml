Commodore Matthew Perry had arrived to force the long-secluded country to open its doors. The subsequent interaction of Americans and Japanese was a dramatic confrontation between peoples of different racial, cultural, and historical backgrounds - we can literally see this unfold in the artwork produced by each side at the time." type="mit.edu,repository,image">

The caption of the print reads, &quot;Com. Perry Paying his Farewell Visit to the Commissioners at Simoda.&quot; &lt;br&gt;The official Narrative describes the event: &quot;The Commodore now transferred his broad pennant from the Powhatan back to the Mississippi, and the two steamers got under way and moved down to the outer roads of Simoda, where they anchored preparatory to their final departure. Moryama Yenoske, in company with some of the other officials, paid a farewell visit to the Commodore on that day, bringing with him the closing accounts of the ships, and some specimens of natural history as presents. A handsome entertainment was spread before the visitors in the cabin, and in the course of the friendly conversation around the table, a Japanese picture, representing the punishment of crucifixion, was shown to Yenoske. This had been purchased at Simoda, by some of our officers, and its presence turned the conversation on the subject of capital punishments in Japan. The Commodore was glad of the opportunity to procure accurate information on this point, inasmuch as some writers, later than Kaempfer, have denied his statement that crucifixion is a Japanese mode of execution. Yenoske said that the picture itself was illustrative merely of a scene in one of their popular farces; but, he added, that regicides were executed somewhat in the manner represented in the picture, being first nailed to a cross and then transfixed with a spear. In the picture, the man was merely &lt;i&gt;tied&lt;/i&gt; to the cross. Decapitation, however, he said, was the usual mode of capital punishment for murderers, but never strangulation or hanging. Upon Yenoske being asked if the practice of Hari-kari or &quot;Happy dispatch&quot; still prevailed, he replied that one of his fellow interpreters had committed suicide in that way, in his presence, while at Nagasaki. The Commodore then inquired if it were true that the governor of Nagasaki had destroyed himself, after the visit of Captain Pellew in 1808; and Yenoske declared that not only the governor had done so, but that two other high officers and ten subordinates had followed his example. The Japanese, after a prolonged conviviality, took their farewell of the Americans, with many expressions of warm attachment to their visitors, and pulled off for the land. &lt;br&gt;&quot;The ships were now all in readiness for departure&amp;#8230;&quot; [pages 486-487]">

Perry, an officer of the highest rank in the navy of the United States, and commander of the squadron now visiting Your imperial majesty's dominions. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;I have directed Commodore Perry to assure your imperial majesty that I entertain the kindest feelings toward your majesty's person and government, and that I have no other object in sending him to Japan but to propose to your imperial majesty that the United States and Japan should live in friendship and have commercial intercourse with each other. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;The Constitution and laws of the United States forbid all interference with the religious or political concerns of other nations. I have particularly charged Commodore Perry to abstain from every act which could possibly disturb the tranquillity of your imperial majesty's dominions. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;The United States of America reach from ocean to ocean, and our Territory of Oregon and State of California lie directly opposite to the dominions of your imperial majesty. Our steamships can go from California to Japan in eighteen days. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;Our great State of California produces about sixty millions of dollars in gold every year, besides silver, quicksilver, precious stones, and many other valuable articles. Japan is also a rich and fertile country, and produces many very valuable articles. Your imperial majesty's subjects are skilled in many of the arts. I am desirous that our two countries should trade with each other, for the benefit both of Japan and the United States. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;We know that the ancient laws of your imperial majesty's government do not allow of foreign trade, except with the Chinese and the Dutch; but as the state of the world changes and new governments are formed, it seems to be wise, from time to time, to make new laws. There was a time when the ancient laws of your imperial majesty's government were first made. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;About the same time America, which is sometimes called the New World, was first discovered and settled by the Europeans. For a long time there were but a few people, and they were poor. They have now become quite numerous; their commerce is very extensive; and they think that if your imperial majesty were so far to change the ancient laws as to allow a free trade between the two countries it would be extremely beneficial to both. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;If your imperial majesty is not satisfied that it would be safe altogether to abrogate the ancient laws which forbid foreign trade, they might be suspended for five or ten years, so as to try the experiment. If it does not prove as beneficial as was hoped, the ancient laws can be restored. The United States often limit their treaties with foreign States to a few years, and then renew them or not, as they please. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;I have directed Commodore Perry to mention another thing to your imperial majesty. Many of our ships pass every year from California to China; and great numbers of our people pursue the whale fishery near the shores of Japan. It sometimes happens, in stormy weather, that one of our ships is wrecked on your imperial majesty's shores. In all such cases we ask, and expect, that our unfortunate people should be treated with kindness, and that their property should be protected, till we can send a vessel and bring them away. We are very much in earnest in this. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;Commodore Perry is also directed by me to represent to your imperial majesty that we understand there is a great abundance of coal and provisions in the Empire of Japan. Our steamships, in crossing the great ocean, burn a great deal of coal, and it is not convenient to bring it all the way from America. We wish that our steamships and other vessels should be allowed to stop in Japan and supply themselves with coal, provisions, and water. They will pay for them in money, or anything else your imperial majesty's subjects may prefer; and we request your imperial majesty to appoint a convenient port, in the southern part of the Empire, where our vessels may stop for this purpose. We are very desirous of this. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;These are the only objects for which I have sent Commodore Perry, with a powerful squadron, to pay a visit to your imperial majesty's renowned city of Yedo: friendship, commerce, a supply of coal and provisions, and protection for our shipwrecked people. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;We have directed Commodore Perry to beg your imperial majesty's acceptance of a few presents.

In witness whereof, I have caused the great seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed, and have subscribed the same with my name, at the city of Washington, in America, the seat of my government, on the thirteenth day of the month of November, in the year one thousand eight hundred and fifty-two. &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;[Seal attached] &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;Your good friend, &lt;p class=&quot;MetadataBody&quot;&gt;MILLARD FILLMORE, President">

<part partId="NarraVision.Description.PartStructureId" value="This watercolor painting is based on Hibata Osuke's 1854 sketches of Perry and five others. The portraits represent, from right to left: Commodore Matthew Perry, Commander Henry A. Adams, English-Japanese translator S. Wells Williams, translator Anton Portman, Captain Joel Abbot, and Perry's son Oliver. &lt;br&gt;Another version of the same run of portraits [52_552] contains interesting variations. &lt;br&gt;From John Dower's Core Exhibit: &quot;The most &quot;realistic&quot; run of portraits of the Americans dates from March 8, 1854, when Perry landed in Yokohama to initiate his second visit. Commissioned by the daimyo of Ogasawara, the original sketches were drawn by Hibata Osuke, a performer of classical Noh drama who studied under the famous woodblock artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi. With some difficulty, Hibata managed to situate himself in the midst of that day's activities and record a great variety of subjects and events. &lt;br&gt;&quot;Other artists subsequently copied his keenly observed renderings of the commodore and five others: Commander Adams; Captain Joel Abbott; S. Wells Williams, a missionary from China who knew some Japanese; a Dutch-Japanese interpreter named Anton Portman (communication often required using Dutch as an intermediary language between English and Japanese); and Perry's son Oliver, who served as his personal secretary. The posing was highly stylized-all in half-profile-and each subject possessed the prominent nose that set Caucasians apart in Japanese eyes. At the same time, each was unmistakably imbued with individuality.&quot;" />

The text that goes with the illustration indicates that this was a 31-year-old woman with a five-year-old girl and nine-year-old boy who arrived in Shimoda a year or two after the Perry mission, on an American ship that included two other young women. It includes a formulaic description of the woman (red hair, high-bridged nose, white complexion), and adds that her teeth were white - a small observation that probably reflects the fact that married women in Japan often blackened their teeth. The brief text by the dog includes a puzzling reference to small protuberances on its neck that resembled &quot;the husk of a chestnut.&quot;">

<part partId="NarraVision.Description.PartStructureId" value="This depiction of a Western woman with two children stands out among the illustrations on the &quot;Assembled Paintings of Commodore Perry's Visit&quot; screen, since no women or children accompanied the Perry expedition. The text that goes with the illustration indicates that this was a 31-year-old woman with a five-year-old girl and nine-year-old boy who arrived in Shimoda a year or two after the Perry mission, on an American ship that included two other young women. It includes a formulaic description of the woman (red hair, high-bridged nose, white complexion), and adds that her teeth were white - a small observation that probably reflects the fact that married women in Japan often blackened their teeth. The brief text by the dog includes a puzzling reference to small protuberances on its neck that resembled &quot;the husk of a chestnut.&quot;" />

He was 6 feet 4 or 5 inches tall. His jacket and trousers were of very very fine wool cloth, with gold tassels on the shoulders. His cap was black leather, and he wore gold embroidered insignia buttons. Though it looked like gold it was probably gold plate. The sword appeared to be made of gold but was probably gold plate. On the wrists were three gold bands. These indicated the rank of the wearer. What he had in his hand was probably a cane. He came on the steamship Powhatan and on the 22 &lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; of the Fourth Month landed and went to the house of Juhei Yamadaya.&quot; &lt;br&gt;Hakodate was one of the two ports the Japanese agreed to open to the Americans in 1854 (the other was Shimoda).
